               <h3>Modern Texture was created some time after I had my son, Yanis. As a newly single mother this was a time where I felt alone, lost and as if I didn’t know who I was anymore. I spent many of my days and hours searching for healing, strength, and overall… Myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                After many months of feeling lost, one day I decided to let my creative side take over. I dipped my hands into this medium and let it take me wherever it needed to on the canvas. It made me reminded me of who I am and what I am capable of. 
                <br>
                <br>
               I wanted to share these special pieces with the world. Not only of my work but as a reminder to all mothers and women all around that healing is possible. Finding yourself again is possible. You are stronger than you may feel.
               <br>
